<p><span style="color:#212121">All Python capabilities are not loaded to our working environment by default (even they are already installed in your system). So, we import each and every library that we want to use.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#212121">In data science, numpy and pandas are most commonly used libraries.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#212121">Numpy is required for calculations like mean, median, square root, etc.</span></li>
	<li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="color:#212121">Pandas is used for data processing and working with CSV files with DataFrames.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color:#212121">We chose alias names for our libraries for the sake of our convenience (numpy --&gt; np and pandas --&gt; pd).</span></p>
