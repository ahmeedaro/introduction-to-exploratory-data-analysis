# EDA Techniques

After you have collected a set of data, how do you do an exploratory data analysis? What techniques do you employ? What do these techniques focus on? What conclusions can you expect to reach?

The following module answers these questions via a gallery of EDA techniques and a detailed description of each method. The techniques are divided into graphical and quantitative techniques. For exploratory data analysis, the emphasis is primarily on graphical techniques.

Some of the common plots used for Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Histograms
* Scatter plots
* Pair plots
* Box plots
* Violin plots
* Distribution Plots
