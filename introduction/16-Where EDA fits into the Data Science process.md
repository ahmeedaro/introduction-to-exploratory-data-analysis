# Where does EDA fit into the data science process?

EDA is one of the many steps in any data science project, from business and data discovery to model building and scoring. EDA forms an integral part of building a machine learning model.

Data scientists spend about 60–70% of their time in a project working through the data cleaning phase to feature engineering. And roughly 40–50% of that time is spent in EDA.
